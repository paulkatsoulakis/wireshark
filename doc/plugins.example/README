This is an example of how to build a Wireshark plugin out-of-tree.

Tested on Linux using GCC 7. Note this builds against Wireshark's *installed*
version. You should of course adapt to your own needs.

To build/install the plugin:

$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install

If your wireshark.pc file is not in one of the standard pkg-config search paths
you will have to tell pkg-config where to find it. Arguably the easiest way to
do so is setting PKG_CONFIG_PATH in your build environment, for example:

$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/lib64/pkgconfig"
