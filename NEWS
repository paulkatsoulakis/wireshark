Wireshark 2.5.1 Release Notes

 This is a semi-experimental release intended to test new features
 for Wireshark 2.6.

 What is Wireshark?

  Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer.
  It is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and
  education.

 What’s New

  Wireshark 2.6 is the last release that will support the legacy
  (GTK+) user interface. It will not be supported or available in
  Wireshark 3.0.

  Many user interface improvements have been made. See the “New
  and Updated Features” section below for more details.

  Dumpcap might not quit if Wireshark or TShark crashes. (Bug
  1419[1])

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly
   updated) since version 2.5.0:

     • HTTP Referer statistics are now supported.

     • Wireshark now supports MaxMind DB files. Support for GeoIP
       and GeoLite Legacy databases has been removed.

     • The Windows packages are now built using Microsoft Visual
       Studio 2017.

     • The IP map feature (the “Map” button in the “Endpoints”
       dialog) has been removed.

   The following features are new (or have been significantly
   updated) since version 2.4.0:

     • Display filter buttons can now be edited, disabled, and
       removed via a context menu directly from the toolbar

     • Drag & Drop filter fields to the display filter toolbar or
       edit to create a button on the fly or apply the filter as a
       display filter.

     • Application startup time has been reduced.

     • Some keyboard shortcut mix-ups have been resolved by
       assigning new shortcuts to Edit → Copy methods.

     • TShark now supports color using the --color option.

     • The "matches" display filter operator is now
       case-insensitive.

     • Display expression (button) preferences have been converted
       to a UAT. This puts the display expressions in their own
       file. Wireshark still supports preference files that
       contain the old preferences, but new preference files will
       be written without the old fields.

     • SMI private enterprise numbers are now read from the
       "enterprises.tsv" configuration file.

     • The QUIC dissector has been renamed to Google QUIC (quic →
       gquic).

     • The selected packet number can now be shown in the Status
       Bar by enabling Preferences → Appearance → Layout → Show
       selected packet number.

     • File load time in the Status Bar is now disabled by default
       and can be enabled in Preferences → Appearance → Layout →
       Show file load time.

     • Support for the G.729A codec in the RTP Player is now added
       via the bcg729 library.

     • Support for hardware-timestamping of packets has been
       added.

     • Improved NetMon .cap support with comments, event tracing,
       network filter, network info types and some Message
       Analyzer exported types.

     • The personal plugins folder on Linux/Unix is now
       ~/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins.

     • TShark can print flow graphs using -z flow…

     • Capinfos now prints SHA256 hashes in addition to RIPEMD160
       and SHA1. MD5 output has been removed.

     • The packet editor has been removed. (This was a GTK+ only
       experimental feature.)

     • Support BBC micro:bit Bluetooth profile

     • The Linux and UNIX installation step for Wireshark will now
       install headers required to build plugins. A pkg-config
       file is provided to help with this (see doc/plugins.example
       for details). Note you must still rebuild all plugins
       between minor releases (X.Y).

     • The Windows installers and packages now ship with Qt 5.9.4.

     • The generic data dissector can now uncompress zlib
       compressed data.

 Getting Wireshark

  Wireshark source code and installation packages are available
  from https://www.wireshark.org/download.html[2].

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark
   packages. You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using
   the package management system specific to that platform. A list
   of third-party packages can be found on the download page[3] on
   the Wireshark web site.

 File Locations

  Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
  preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
  These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
  About→Folders to find the default locations on your system.

 Known Problems

  The BER dissector might infinitely loop. (Bug 1516[4])

  Capture filters aren’t applied when capturing from named pipes.
  (Bug 1814[5])

  Filtering tshark captures with read filters (-R) no longer
  works. (Bug 2234[6])

  Application crash when changing real-time option. (Bug 4035[7])

  Wireshark and TShark will display incorrect delta times in some
  cases. (Bug 4985[8])

  Wireshark should let you work with multiple capture files. (Bug
  10488[9])

 Getting Help

  Community support is available on Wireshark’s Q&A site[10] and
  on the wireshark-users mailing list. Subscription information
  and archives for all of Wireshark’s mailing lists can be found
  on the web site[11].

  Official Wireshark training and certification are available from
  Wireshark University[12].
